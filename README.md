# Service API

This library provides an API for starting and stopping services, and in addition, manages dependenices between services to ensure that they start in the right order.

It was originally part of [Krail](https://github.com/KrailOrg/krail/), but has been extracted as something which might be useful in its own right.

Krail actually uses a simplified version of this now, but if this library could be of interest to you, please feel free to raise an issue.
